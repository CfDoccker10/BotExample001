Please install the Microsoft Bot SDK first, then download the Microsoft Bot Emulator
Open the solution and resolve unresolved references, this was the hardest part as I experienced it until I used
  the NuGet tool in Visual Studio to automatically resolve the missing assemblies when I had the solution open in Visual Studio.
To run the solution, just run it in debug mode or without debug mode
  Then execute the Mirsoft Bot emulator.
If you have trouble connectin to the Bot using your local computer, go to the command line prompt (cmd) and type in ipconfig
  and copy and past the IP address into the connection input box within the Microsoft Bot emulator. This worked for me.
Let me know if you have any problems and I'll do my best, time is limited, to get back to you.

Thank you
