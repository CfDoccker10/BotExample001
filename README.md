Please install the Microsoft Bot SDK first, then download the Microsoft Bot Emulator.
Open the solution and resolve unresolved references that are flagged under the "References" folder, this was the hardest part as I experienced it until I used  NuGet in the "Tools" menu within Visual Studio -- this automatically resolve the missing assemblies when I had the solution open in Visual Studio.
To run the solution, just run it in debug mode or without debug mode, then execute the Microsoft Bot emulator.
If you have trouble connecting to the Bot using your local computer, go to the command line prompt (cmd) and type in ipconfig and copy and past the IP address into the connection input box within the Microsoft Bot emulator. This worked for me.
Let me know if you have any problems and I'll do my best, time is limited, to get back to you.

Thank you
